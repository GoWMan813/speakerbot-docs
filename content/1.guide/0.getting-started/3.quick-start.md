# Quick Start Guide

Make sure you've completed the following:

::list{type=primary}
- [Install Speaker.bot](/guide/getting-started/install)
- [Twitch Account Setup](/guide/getting-started/accounts)
- [Speech Engine Setup](/guide/getting-started/speech-engines)
::

## Create a Voice Alias
::list{type=info}
- Navigate to `Settings -> Voice Aliases`
::

Enter a `Name` for your alias and select your desired output device.

For the purposes of this guide, I recommend leaving the output device set to `Application Default`, which will use your current default audio output device.

::list{type=success}
- `Test Speak` at the bottom of the view should now successfully speak the test message.
::

## Enable Global TTS
::list{type=info}
- Navigate to `Settings -> General`
::

1. Ensure the `Enabled` checkbox is checked.
    - This toggles the TTS engine on or off globally.
2. Select a `Default Voice Alias`
    - Choose the voice alias you created in the previous steps

## Test TTS from Twitch
::list{type=primary}
- Your Speaker.bot instance should now be ready to speak commands from Twitch Chat!
::

1. Open Twitch Chat for the account you authenticated with Speaker.bot
2. Enter `!say test` :copy-button{content="!say test"}

::list{type=success}
If everything is working, Speaker.bot should have spoken "Test"!
