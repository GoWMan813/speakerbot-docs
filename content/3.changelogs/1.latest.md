## Speaker.bot
Starting with this release of Speaker.bot, I can now digitally sign it, and it's accompanying libraries.

What does this mean? I'm hoping less (or no more) false positives and/or AV software nuking the exe before or while its running. Also, building a better level of trust within Windows, as well as you, the end-user.

In order to obtain the certificate used to digitally sign these applications, a legal entity has been setup, and undergone third-party (ssl.com) validation to verify it and the status of the company.

## New Engine
With the release of 0.1.2, Speaker.bot now supports a new engine, ElevenLabs.io!  Be sure to check them out.

## Uber Duck
Uber Duck seems to have undergone some major changes, and sadly, I was not aware of them to keep Speaker.bot up to date.  Moving forward, UberDuck no longer has all the community submitted voices.

Speaker.bot still supports what is available at UberDuck.

## Headless Mode
You read that right, you can now run Speaker.bot headless, as in no GUI, only a log file.

Consider this mode very very experimental, since there is no GUI initialization anymore.

To run Speaker.bot in headless mode, just add `/headless`, and to stop it, add `/shutdown` when running it.
`Speaker.bot.exe /headless`
`Speaker.bot.exe /shutdown`

## Streamer.bot Integration
Starting with **Streamer.bot v0.2.2-alpha.8**, there is a tighter integration between the two apps.

Within **Streamer.bot**, there is a new Speak sub-action, and it has 3 ways it can work.

1. How you're use to with the UDP in a fire and forget fashion
2. Silent option, when selected, this will only process the speech, and, if the setting is enabled in Speaker.bot, write the audio to a file, and will add a `%speechFile%` argument so you can pass it to a Play Sound sub-action, or other
3. Delay option, the most requested feature, yes, this will delay the sub-action from continuing until the audio has been played by Speaker.bot

Using either the Silent or Delay option also introduces a timeout of 30 seconds, so it does not get stuck, in a future version, this may be configurable (within reason)

Theese sub-actions within Streamer.bot, also add the duration of the speech to its arguments.

Again, at the moment, this new integration is only available in the alpha versions of Streamer.bot
